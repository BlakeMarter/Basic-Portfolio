            <p>Hello World! My name is Blake Marter. Currently, I am a student but I am much more than that.Among other things, I have a passion for golf, video games, and coding.</p> 
            <p>I started golfing when I was 4 years old, and have loved it ever since. I've played in many local and state-wide tournements in my day, and I absolutely love the sport.</p>
            <p>Video games are another love of mine. I have had most of the consoles growing up, but most recently, I have delved into the world of Destiny1/2 and can't seem to stop!</p>
            <p>Lastly, I have a passion for coding. Although, I am new to the coding world, I can't seem to get enough of it. I still have a lot to learn, but I am eager and willing to take on any challenges that lie ahead.</p>
